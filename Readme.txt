Work: sentiment Classification of Movie Reviews using an RNN

-----
Objective:

The objective of this lab work is to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using the IMDB dataset.

-----
Dataset:

The IMDB dataset is a commonly used dataset for text classification. It is already integrated in Keras, which makes it easy to use.

-----
Steps:

1. Loading the data

Import the IMDB dataset from Keras.

Preprocess the data (e.g., truncate or pad sequences).

2. Data preparation

Convert movie reviews into sequences of integers (each word is represented by an integer).

Limit the length of the reviews to a fixed size.

3. Building the RNN model

Use an Embedding layer to encode the word sequences.

Add an RNN layer (SimpleRNN).

Add a Dense layer for binary classification (positive/negative).

4. Model compilation and training

Compile the model with a binary loss function and an optimizer.

Train the model on the training data.

Visualize the model's performance on the validation data.

5. Model evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.

Display accuracy and the confusion matrix.
